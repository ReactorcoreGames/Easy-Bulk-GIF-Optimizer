## Devlog: Massive Overhaul - Easy Bulk GIF Optimizer is Here

I'm excited to finally share the complete overhaul of Easy Bulk GIF Optimizer! The old version was functional, but it pales in comparison to what I've built here. It's a ground-up redesign focused on speed, usability, and power.

### What Makes This Version Special

**Modern Interface**
I rebuilt the entire GUI with a sleek neo-retro dark theme that actually looks good. The interface is clean, intuitive, and responsive even during heavy batch processing.

**Three Modes, One Tool**
The new version combines video conversion, image sequence animation, and GIF optimization into a single streamlined workflow. Switch between modes with a dropdown, and the app intelligently adapts to what you're working with.

**Frame Extraction Bonus**
This one was almost an accident, but it turned out to be incredibly useful: Mode 1 can now extract individual frames from videos as high-quality PNGs. Enable "Keep temp files" and you get a numbered sequence of every frame. Great for creating thumbnails, picking specific frames, or even feeding those frames back into Mode 2 for precise GIF control.

**Built for Bulk**
This tool is designed for people who need to process dozens or hundreds of files. Multi-threaded processing keeps the GUI responsive, file count displays show exactly how many files were detected, and comprehensive logging tracks everything that happens. It's production-ready and built for real workflows.

### Who Is This For?

If you're a game developer creating animated sprites, a content creator making GIFs for social media, or just someone who needs to batch process media files, this tool will save you hours. It's fast, reliable, and handles edge cases gracefully.

The old version got the job done, but this one is what I always wanted it to be. I hope you find it as useful as I do.
